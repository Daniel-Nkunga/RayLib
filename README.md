# RayLib
Initial projects and experimentations for RayLib. If Advent of Code 2024 doesn't have at least 15 starts by the time you're seeing this, I got too distracted doing this.

This project is on a temporary pause. I had a lot of fun working on it over break, but when trying to expand the scope the projects, I kept getting bottlenecked in trying to make my features robust. The pause wil be to make a few games in a commercial game engine to see which features I'll need to develop for my own engine and how I should develop them. 
Following this project, I will be making a few games in Unity as:
  - I didn't enjoy Godot much when I used it last; Any games made in Godot are either limited to PC or have to be licensed to console through a third party due to the nature of Godot being open source
  - Because Unity has a history of predatory pricing changes, it will force me to eventually come back to developing my own engine
