Simple Pong Game following the tutorial by [Programming with Nick](https://youtube.com/@programmingwithnick?si=yOLngI-kGDqkBEbJ) and their [ðŸ”¥Pong Game with C++ and Raylib - Beginner Tutorial](https://youtu.be/VLJlTaFvHo4?si=PWOQtQWt4h_BPpYB) tutorial. 

Notes:
- I took a break (went to sleep) in between finishing the game and adding the colors and tried to do them on my own the morning after
- Great code but I didn't like having collisions handled only in main; that seemed bad long term development and felt like it would become quickly convoluted the longer a project went on
